# University Maintenance Reporting App

**Project for Module: PBDV**

Welcome to the Maintenance Reporting App, a project developed as part of the PBDV module. This web application was designed to streamline the process of reporting and managing maintenance issues across the university campus.

## Project Overview

The system allows users to easily report maintenance issues around the campus, enabling faster resolution by the appropriate staff. The app features roles for different users, including **Technician**, **Admin**, **Staff**, and **General Users**.

### Key Features:
- **Email Validation**: Ensures users' email addresses are verified for secure communication.
- **Issue Reporting**: Allows users to submit maintenance requests for campus issues, which are then assigned to technicians for resolution.
- **Role-Based Access**: Different levels of access and functionality for Technicians, Admins, Staff, and General Users.

## Team Members

This project was developed by a team of five members. Each member took on specific roles to bring the app to life. I focused on **frontend development**, implementing key user interface components to ensure smooth user interactions with the system.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Python (Flask)
- **Database**: SQLite
- **Other Libraries**: Flask-WTF for form handling, email validation tools.
